The NDF to Excel conversion script will take all NDF files in the "LMSIMData" directory and create a subdirectory called 'output' where it will store the Excel files with V in the first column, and A in the second column. 

The Excel files can be directly opened in Excel

and it is easy to e.g. make a scatter plot of the data

It is easy to open additional files and copy paste e.g. A currents from one file into the other and make comparison plots, like shown below. Although that Excel is not so good for data analysis it can be used for spreadsheet analysis where multiple parameters can be seen.
