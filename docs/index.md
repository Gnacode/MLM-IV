We have four programs for use in simulation and analysis of Langmuir IV Probes based on Merlino RL, [American Journal of Physics, Vol 75, issue 12, pages 1078-1085](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-abstract/75/12/1078/899100/Understanding-Langmuir-probe-current-voltage?redirectedFrom=fulltext):

1. [**MLM-IV-TheoryPlots**](MLM-TheoryPlots.md), this program plots theoretical plots as outlined by Merlino 2007, and with an overlay of leakage current and capacitive artifacts. In general, it is based in equation 3, and 6 from the paper, and data from 
2. [**MLM-IV-SimPlot**](MLM-IV-SimPlot.md), this program generates IV curves with embedded leakage current and capacitive effects, and subjected to a gaussian noise to create a realistic data set. The data are output in the [**NPY data format**](NPY-Data-Format.md) which is compatible with [**MLM-IV-Analysis**](MLM-IV-Analysis.md) and other analysis packages as e.g. [**PlasmaPy**](https://www.plasmapy.org/)
3. [**MLM-IV-Analysis**](MLM-IV-Analysis.md)
4. [**MLM-IV-EEDF-Analysis**](MLM-IV-EEDF-Analysis.md)

(N.B. MLM stands for "Merlino Langmuir" referring to the 2007 Am.J.Physics paper)

The documentation for each individual program can be found by clicking on the link in the list above. Here we will outline some general features. The programs are written in Python 3.11. and the requirements.txt file contains a list over the Python libraries and their versions required to run the program. If the programs are downloaded and installed using Git (see [Installation](installation.md))

The NPY file format generated by the [**MLM-IV-SimPlot**](MLM-IV-SimPlot.md) is described here: [**NPY file format**](NPY-Data-Format.md)
